Each subdirectory is named ``proposal`` with a number ``1``, ``2``, ``3``. It shows 
a potential directory structure we can adopt when using easybuild to push container recipes.
It follows a similar directory structure format adopted by ``easybuild-easyconfigs`` but it 
is slightly different. 

Proposal 1 - Mimics the format found in http://mirror.centos.org/
Proposal 2 - Categorizes recipe file by easybuild base images
Proposal 3 - Mix of proposal 1 and 2

Note the directory structure does not show the arch (``x86_64``, ``amd64``). We can add that in if needed or
it can be simply documented.
